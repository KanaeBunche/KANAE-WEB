        <p>
          My name is Kanae Bunche, I am first a woman of God who fears the Lord. I am then a sister and a daughter. 
          Then I am a student currently obtaining my Bachelor in Political Science at SUNY Plattsburgh and am pursuing 
          Software Engineering through Flatiron Boot Camp. I was born and raised in the South Bronx, where some people dare to go. 
          I have been faced with challenges in life 
          but never have those challenges prevented me from dreaming and dedicating my life to accomplishing those dreams.</p></div>
      <div class="panel" id="two-panel">
        <div class="panel-title">Why I Pursure Software Engineering ?</div>
        <p>I  am pursuing  software engineering because it has become a part of who I am. 
          At first, it was very intimidating, I had to talk to a computer using sentences and phrases,
          I normally would not form together. But as time went by coding became a challenge my brian yearned for. 
          It was as if I was able to access another part of my brain.  I am always learning and growing in this 
            profession which keeps me continuously humbled and ready for the next challenge!!</p>

      <div class="panel" id="three-panel">
        <div class="panel-title">What are my Aspirations?</div>
        <p>I see software engineering as a way to give back to my community and share my skills with those who are unaware of 
          these opportunities or who may not have the resources to pursue software engineering. I want to be able to teach the 
          less fortunate about this aspect of computers to give them hope for a better future,
           and allow someone else to experience a sense of purpose and meaning in life, while simplifying acquiring a skill. </p>
